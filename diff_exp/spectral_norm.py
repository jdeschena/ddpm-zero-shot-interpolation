        # NB: If `do_power_iteration` is set, the `u` and `v` vectors are
        #     updated in power iteration **in-place**. This is very important
        #     because in `DataParallel` forward, the vectors (being buffers) are
        #     broadcast from the parallelized module to each module replica,
        #     which is a new module object created on the fly. And each replica
        #     runs its own spectral norm power iteration. So simply assigning
        #     the updated vectors to the module this function runs on will cause
        #     the update to be lost forever. And the next time the parallelized
        #     module is replicated, the same randomly initialized vectors are
        #     broadcast and used!
        #
        #     Therefore, to make the change propagate back, we rely on two
        #     important behaviors (also enforced via tests):
        #       1. `DataParallel` doesn't clone storage if the broadcast tensor
        #          is already on correct device; and it makes sure that the
        #          parallelized module is already on `device[0]`.
        #       2. If the out tensor in `out=` kwarg has correct shape, it will
        #          just fill in the values.
        #     Therefore, since the same power iteration is performed on all
        #     devices, simply updating the tensors in-place will make sure that
        #     the module replica on `device[0]` will update the _u vector on the
        #     parallelized module (by shared storage).
        #
        #    However, after we update `u` and `v` in-place, we need to **clone**
        #    them before using them to normalize the weight. This is to support
        #    backproping through two forward passes, e.g., the common pattern in
        #    GAN training: loss = D(real) - D(fake). Otherwise, engine will
        #    complain that variables needed to do backward for the first forward
        #    (i.e., the `u` and `v` vectors) are changed in the second forward.

        \sigma(\mathbf{W}) = \max_{\mathbf{h}: \mathbf{h} \ne 0} \dfrac{\|\mathbf{W} \mathbf{h}\|_2}{\|\mathbf{h}\|_2}

    Spectral normalization stabilizes the training of discriminators (critics)
    in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by reducing the Lipschitz constant
    of the model. :math:`\sigma` is approximated performing one iteration of the
    `power method`_ every time the weight is accessed. If the dimension of the
    weight tensor is greater than 2, it is reshaped to 2D in power iteration
    method to get spectral norm.

    .. note::
        This function is implemented using the parametrization functionality
        in :func:`~torch.nn.utils.parametrize.register_parametrization`. It is a
        reimplementation of :func:`torch.nn.utils.spectral_norm`.

    .. note::
        When this constraint is registered, the singular vectors associated to the largest
        singular value are estimated rather than sampled at random. These are then updated
        performing :attr:`n_power_iterations` of the `power method`_ whenever the tensor
        is accessed with the module on `training` mode.

    .. note::
        If the `_SpectralNorm` module, i.e., `module.parametrization.weight[idx]`,
        is in training mode on removal, it will perform another power iteration.
        If you'd like to avoid this iteration, set the module to eval mode
        before its removal.

    Args:
        module (nn.Module): containing module
        name (str, optional): name of weight parameter. Default: ``"weight"``.

            calculate spectral norm. Default: ``1``.
        eps (float, optional): epsilon for numerical stability in

        dim (int, optional): dimension corresponding to number of outputs.
            Default: ``0``, except for modules that are instances of
            ConvTranspose{1,2,3}d, when it is ``1``

    Returns:
        The original module with a new parametrization registered to the specified
